            <h1>The Warriors | Pulp Fiction</h1>
            <p class="small">Walter Hill’s cult classic 'The Warriors' has provided inspiration for a number of modern genre filmmakers. Quentin Tarantino is clearly among them, as he imitates a couple of shots from The Warriors in Pulp Fiction: a closeup of a character’s lips as they speak into a microphone.</p>

        <p class="big">The shot through <span class="underline">Butch’s windshield of Marsellus Wallace crossing the street</span> and turning to face the driver is taken straight from Alfred Hitchcock’s Psycho.</p>

        <p class="small">In Pulp Fiction, it’s significant because Butch thought he was off scot-free, having killed Vincent and taken his father’s watch from his apartment. But Marsellus, who wants Butch dead and has simply gone out to get donuts and coffee, sees him leaving the complex.</p>

        <p class="small">Instead of keeping his cool like Marion did, Butch slams down on the gas and runs Marsellus over, leading to an intense action scene.</p>

    <div class="psycho_text">
        <p class="big">In Psycho, this shot is significant because Marion Crane is embezzling $40,000 from her boss and he’s just spotted her skipping town with the money.</p>
