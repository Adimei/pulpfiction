                        <p class="small">In a 1994 interview with Empire magazine, Tarantino said, "I steal from every single movie ever made." Tarantino's visual references to movies have become his trademark.</p>
                        <p class="small">Some of these references are merely hinted at, while others are almost identical replications. For this reason, he's been the center of controversy for many years.</p>

                    <p class="small">Walter Hill’s cult classic 'The Warriors' has provided inspiration for a number of modern genre filmmakers. Quentin Tarantino is clearly among them, as he imitates a couple of shots from The Warriors in Pulp Fiction: a closeup of a character’s lips as they speak into a microphone.</p>

        <div class="butch_wallas_text>
            <p class="small">In Pulp Fiction, it’s significant because Butch thought he was off scot-free, having killed Vincent and taken his father’s watch from his apartment. But Marsellus, who wants Butch dead and has simply gone out to get donuts and coffee, sees him leaving the complex.</p>

            <p class="small">Instead of keeping his cool like Marion did, Butch slams down on the gas and runs Marsellus over, leading to an intense action scene.</p>
